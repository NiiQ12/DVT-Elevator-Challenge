DVT Elevator Challenge

The task is to develop a challenging console application in C# that simulates the movement of
elevators within a large building, with the aim of optimizing passenger transportation efficiently. The
applicaƟon should adhere to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity
and maintainability.

The console applicaƟon must include the following key features:
1. Real-Time Elevator Status
Display the real-Ɵme status of each elevator, including its current floor, direcƟon of movement,
whether it's in moƟon or staƟonary, and the number of passengers it is carrying.
2. InteracƟve Elevator Control
Allow users to interact with the elevators through the console applicaƟon. Users should be able
to call an elevator to a specific floor and indicate the number of passengers waiƟng on each floor.
3. MulƟple Floors and Elevators Support
Design the applicaƟon to accommodate buildings with mulƟple floors and mulƟple elevators.
Ensure that elevators can efficiently move between different floors.
4. Efficient Elevator Dispatching
Implement an algorithm that efficiently directs the nearest available elevator to respond to an
elevator request. Minimize wait Ɵmes for passengers and opƟmize elevator usage.
5. Passenger Limit Handling
Consider the maximum passenger limit for each elevator. Prevent the elevator from becoming
overloaded and handle scenarios where addiƟonal elevators might be required.
6. ConsideraƟon for Different Elevator Types
Although the challenge focuses on passenger elevators, consider the existence of other elevator
types, such as high-speed elevators, glass elevators, and freight elevators. Plan the applicaƟon's
architecture to accommodate future extension for these types.
7. Real-Time OperaƟon
Ensure that the console applicaƟon operates in real-Ɵme, providing immediate responses to user
interacƟons and accurately reflecƟng elevator movements and status.
Keep in mind that the building has a central computer controlling all elevators, and the applicaƟon
should consider the coordinaƟon of mulƟple elevators' movements.

Your soluƟon should demonstrate an efficient and well-structured approach, showcasing your
understanding of OOP principles, algorithm design, and real-Ɵme processing. The challenge is
designed to test your ability to build a sophisƟcated elevator simulaƟon capable of handling various
scenarios found in a large building with mulƟple elevator types.
