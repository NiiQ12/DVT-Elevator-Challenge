DVT Elevator Challenge

The task is to develop a challenging console application in C# that simulates the movement of
elevators within a large building, with the aim of optimizing passenger transportation efficiently. The
application should adhere to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity
and maintainability.

The console application must include the following key features:
1. Real-Time Elevator Status
Display the real-time status of each elevator, including its current floor, direction of movement,
whether it's in motion or stationary, and the number of passengers it is carrying.
2. Interactive Elevator Control
Allow users to interact with the elevators through the console application. Users should be able
to call an elevator to a specific floor and indicate the number of passengers waiting on each floor.
3. Multiple Floors and Elevators Support
Design the application to accommodate buildings with multiple floors and multiple elevators.
Ensure that elevators can efficiently move between different floors.
4. Efficient Elevator Dispatching
Implement an algorithm that efficiently directs the nearest available elevator to respond to an
elevator request. Minimize wait times for passengers and optimize elevator usage.
5. Passenger Limit Handling
Consider the maximum passenger limit for each elevator. Prevent the elevator from becoming
overloaded and handle scenarios where additional elevators might be required.
6. Consideration for Different Elevator Types
Although the challenge focuses on passenger elevators, consider the existence of other elevator
types, such as high-speed elevators, glass elevators, and freight elevators. Plan the application's
architecture to accommodate future extension for these types.
7. Real-Time Operation
Ensure that the console application operates in real-time, providing immediate responses to user
interactions and accurately reflecting elevator movements and status.
Keep in mind that the building has a central computer controlling all elevators, and the application
should consider the coordination of multiple elevators' movements.

Your solution should demonstrate an efficient and well-structured approach, showcasing your
understanding of OOP principles, algorithm design, and real-time processing. The challenge is
designed to test your ability to build a sophisticated elevator simulation capable of handling various
scenarios found in a large building with multiple elevator types.
